       <h2>Ups and downs: positioning elements with CSS</h2>
        <div class="article-paragraph">
          <p>
            If you want to make a website, chances are you have a bunch of stuff that needs to go on it. Text, images, videos, animations and any other stuff that you find on a website are called <strong>elements.</strong> 
            <br><br>
            Elements contain the content of a website. But what decides where they go on the page, and what they look like? Web developers use style sheets to define sets of rules that determine how elements are displayed.
            <br><br>
            These style sheets, known as <strong>CSS sheets</strong>, define things like what font is used to display text, whether boxes have borders around them and what colour the background is.

          <h3>Positioning</h3> 
          <p>
            Today, we are going to talk about a specific CSS property called positioning. Positioning allows us to control where elements go on the page and how they behave in comparison to other elements.
            <br><br>
            One thing we will talk about is the document flow of the page. By default, elements are arranged in the order they appear in the code. Some types of elements take up a whole line, meaning the next element is displayed on the line below. Others can be displayed in the same line. 
            <br><br>
            By changing the positioning of an element we can move it from its position in the document flow - or take it out of the flow altogether. Let’s look at how this works.
            
           </p>  
      </div>
      <div class="article-paragraph">
        <h3>Static</h3>
        <p>
          Static means that the element will take its normal place within the flow of the document. You don’t usually need to specify this since it is the default setting.
          <br><br>
          Here, we have two different kinds of element. One displays a red box, the other a blue box. Both of them take up the whole line, so the next element is displayed on a new line. We will be moving the blue box around to illustrate different kinds of positioning. Right now, it is in its normal place in the flow of the document.
       </p>
      </div>
      <div class="article-image-container">

        <img src="../images/blog-positioning/box-example-1.png" class="article-image">
      </div>
        <div class="article-paragraph">
          <h3>Relative</h3>
          <p>
            The element will take its normal place in the flow of the document, but you can move it around relative to this position.
            <br><br>
            Using the commands <strong>top</strong>, <strong>right</strong>, <strong>bottom</strong> and <strong>left</strong>, you can add space on each side of the element that will push it around on the page. Here, the code <strong>left: 100px;</strong> is used to add 100 pixels of space to the left of where it was previously.
            <br><br>
            You can also use the command <strong>z-index</strong> to determine the depth of the element. Where two elements overlap each other, the one with the higher z-index will appear on top.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="article-image-container">

        <img src="../images/blog-positioning/box-example-2.png" class="article-image">
        <div class="article-inset">
          <p><strong>Uses:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>lining up elements so that they are flush with each other</li>
              <li>creating visually striking layouts that "break the grid"</li>
              <li>arranging images to display on top of one another</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
        <div class="article-paragraph">
          <h3>Fixed</h3>
          <p>
            The element is now removed from the normal flow of the document. As you can see, the red boxes are now stacked one after the other. They do not leave space for the blue box.
            <br>
            <br>
            The element is now positioned relative to the viewport - what you can see on the screen. The default position (0,0) is at the top left hand corner of the screen. You can still use the top, right, bottom and left commands to move the element relative to this position and it will stay in the same position on the screen when you scroll.
          </p>
          </div>
          <div class="article-image-container">
            <div class="article-inset">
              <p><strong>Uses:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>creating UI elements that "float" on top of the page such as navigation bars</li>
                  <li>creating pop-ups for user input</li>
                </ul>

          <div class="article-paragraph">
            <h3>Absolute</h3>
            <p>
              Similarly to <strong>fixed</strong>, the element is removed from the normal flow of the document. But, its position is now determined relative to its nearest parent element. 
              <br>
              <br>
              For example, the blue box has now been placed inside a larger box. This larger box has a fixed position. The blue box is contained within the larger box but can be moved relative to its position using the top, right, bottom and left commands.
