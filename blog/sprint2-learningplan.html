      <h2>My learning plan</h2>
        <div class="article-paragraph">
          <p>
            This post outlines my learning plan. I will abide by this plan as long as I am studying at DevAcademy.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="article-paragraph">
            <h3>Long-term goal</h3>
            <p>Eventually, I hope that I can have my own website, content and design studio. With my experience in written content and user experience, I would aim at small to medium businesses for these reasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>they will find it easier to deal with just one person for all of their digital needs
                </li>
                <li>they may have little technological experience and could get ripped off in the marketplace by larger companies who won’t deliver them results</li>
                <li>they should be able to save on overall costs by coming to me.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I am not opposed to following other career pathways that may turn up. These could include working full-time for a larger firm, getting into cybersecurity or taking on a role with a company that liaises between content creators and web developers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="article-paragraph">
            <h3>Strengths and limitations</h3>
            <p>My strengths as a learner are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I am adaptable and pick up new skills easily</li>
                <li>when I enjoy something I become passionate and I can put a lot of effort in</li>
                <li>I am creative and can come up with innovative solutions to problem</li>
            </ul>
            <p>My weaknesses are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I am easily distracted and can waste a lot of time this way</li>
                <li>I can lose motivation towards the end of a project because I like starting things more than finishing them</li>
                <li>I have poor personal organisation</li>
                <li>I have bodily pain problems that can make it hard for me to learn when I have flare-ups</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="article-paragraph">
            <h3>Skills to develop</h3>
            <p>The personal skills I would like to develop are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>personal organisation (especially time management)</li>
                <li>consistency of effort throughout projects</li>
                <li>being more mindful to manage my response to my pain.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="article-paragraph">
            <h3>Workload management</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>During foundations, I will work at the campus more days than I work from home. I am more productive here.</li>
                <li>During boot camp, I will be out of bed 1hr30mins before I need to be at campus. This will ensure I am always on time and ready to learn.</li>
                <li>I will use the Toggl app to track my time and compare this to the TimeBoxes.</li>
                <li>I will complete my reflections for each task immediately after I have done the task.</li>
                <li>When I am stuck, I will reach out to my facilitator if I feel frustrated.</li>
                <li>I will write down problems in my book so that I can remember them when talking to my facilitator.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="article-paragraph">
            <h3>My expectations from the facilitators</h3>
            <p>All I expect from the facilitation team is to maintain the level of quality I have received so far. The level of teaching, support and communication so far has been great.
                <br><br>
                This looks like:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Being reasonably available to respond to my problems. I don’t want to put hard times on this because life can be hectic but I would normally expect to get help within a few hours of reaching out.</li>
                <li>Being able to explain things in a different way if I don’t understand the course material</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="article-paragraph">
            <h3>Block-out times</h3>
            <p>I have block-out times that can’t be predicted. I have a weekly appointment at the osteopath that moves around all the time. I also can need to take further time as I have flare-ups with pain or other related medical problems.
                <br><br>
                Because of this, I need the course to be able to be reasonably flexible if I have to miss time unexpectedly. For my part, I will endeavour to catch up as soon as possible when this happens.
