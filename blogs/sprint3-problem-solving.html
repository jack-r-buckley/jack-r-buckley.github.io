    <h2>Problem-solving at DevAcademy</h2>
    <div class="article-paragraph">
      <p>
        My time studying at DevAcademy so far has been full of problem-solving. What I’ve learned so far is that coding is mostly 
        problem-solving. You learn the way that you are supposed to do something and you go about trying to code it. 
        Then you run the code and find that it doesn’t get past the fourth line. So what do you do?
        <br><br>
        You troubleshoot. You identify the problems, you obtain information that will help you fix the problems and 
        you come up with a solution. This blog will go over some problem solving situations I had and what I did about them.

      <h3>Blocked by a Simple Problem</h3>
        <p>
          I was trying to write a JavaScript function that capitalised the first letter of every word in a sentence. It took me a long 
          time to work out a solution (this is the subject of the next paragraph) but in the end I was sure I had it.
          <br><br>
          Only, it didn’t work. All I got was a massive wall of red error text. The problem was that I was sure my solution would 
          work. I went back to Google to find out why I was getting the error.
          <br><br>
          I was looking through my logic - the basic idea of what my code was trying to do. In this case I was trying to:
          <ol>
            <li>Split the sentence into an array where each word was its own individual item.</li>
            <li>Use a looping function to run the same set of code on each of these words in turn.</li>
            <li>Edit each of those words so that they had the first letter capitalised.</li>
            <li>Mash all of these individual words back into a single string.</li>
          </ol>
          To cut a long story short, there was no flaw in the logic. After half an hour of searching I discovered that the 
          function I was using to split the string into an array needed this after it: (“ “). I had been undone by a simple 
          pair of brackets and some quote marks.
          <br><br>
          It was frustrating, but I maintained a methodical approach to problem solving that found the problem before too long. 
          After confirming the logic I figured it had to be a syntax problem and I went through the commands one by one looking 
          for the flaw.

      <h3>An Elegant Solution</h3>
      <p>
        I was trying to write a JavaScript function that capitalised the first letter in every word in a sentence. If that sounds 
        familiar it’s because it was the same situation as in the first paragraph.
        <br><br>
        At the beginning of the challenge I could only come up with a very convoluted way of doing this. Surely, I thought, this 
        couldn’t be the way. My plan involved creating a loop that read through every character in a sentence. I would make a 
        “switch” variable that would turn “on” whenever the reading function encountered a space. It would then capitalise the 
        next character and turn the switch “off”.
        <br><br>
        Thinking about how to code this, I realised there must be an easier way. I thought, if only each word could be its 
        own string, I wouldn’t have to do it on a character by character basis. I could just apply the same function to each 
        word using a loop.
        <br><br>
        That’s when I realised I could do this - by turning the string into an array. I Googled to see if this was possible and 
        sure enough there was an inbuilt JavaScript function to turn a string into an array.
