    <h2>My Learning Plan</h2>
    <div class="article-paragraph">
      <p>
        This post outlines my learning plan. I will abide by this plan as long as I am studying at DevAcademy.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="article-paragraph">
      <h3>Long-term goal</h3>
      <p>
        Eventually, I hope that I can have my own website, content and design studio. With my experience in written content 
        and user experience, I would aim at small to medium businesses for these reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>they will find it easier to deal with just one person for all of their digital needs</li>
        <li>they may have little technological experience and could get ripped off in the marketplace by larger companies who wonâ€™t deliver them results</li>
        <li>they should be able to save on overall costs by coming to me.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I am not opposed to following other career pathways that may turn up. These could include working full-time for a 
        larger firm, getting into cybersecurity or taking on a role with a company that liaises between content creators 
        and web developers.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="article-paragraph">
      <h3>Strengths and limitations</h3>
      <p>
        My strengths as a learner are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>I am adaptable and pick up new skills easily</li>
        <li>when I enjoy something I become passionate and I can put a lot of effort in</li>
        <li>I am creative and can come up with innovative solutions to problem</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        My weaknesses are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>I am easily distracted and can waste a lot of time this way</li>
        <li>I can lose motivation towards the end of a project because I like starting things more than finishing them</li>
        <li>I have poor personal organisation</li>
        <li>I have bodily pain problems that can make it hard for me to learn when I have flare-ups</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="article-paragraph">
      <h3>Skills to develop</h3>
      <p>
        The personal skills I would like to develop are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>personal organisation (especially time management)</li>
        <li>consistency of effort throughout projects</li>
        <li>being more mindful to manage my response to my pain.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="article-paragraph">
      <h3>Workload management</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>During foundations, I will work at the campus more days than I work from home. I am more productive here.</li>
          <li>During boot camp, I will be out of bed 1hr30mins before I need to be at campus. This will ensure I am always on time and ready to learn.</li>
          <li>I will use the Toggl app to track my time and compare this to the TimeBoxes.</li>
          <li>I will complete my reflections for each task immediately after I have done the task.</li>
          <li>When I am stuck, I will reach out to my facilitator if I feel frustrated.</li>
          <li>I will write down problems in my book so that I can remember them when talking to my facilitator.</li>
        </ul>
