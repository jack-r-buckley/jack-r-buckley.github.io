    <h2>My Learning Journey</h2>
    <div class="article-paragraph">
      <p>
        We’ve learned a lot in five weeks. Of course, the learning speed is about to be cranked up to warp nine starting 
        on monday. But, we have already come a long way.
        <br><br>
        A big part of the learning journey has been the Core curriculum. The non-technical part of the course has 
        been illuminating in several ways. This blog contains my response to the Core curriculum and my journey through it.

      <h3>Meditation</h3>
      <p>
        About five years ago I meditated regularly. Looking back, I can’t remember why I stopped. I got a lot out of it. 
        I felt more relaxed and emotionally stable.
        <br><br>
        So, when meditation came up as a Core curriculum task I took to it like a fish to water. I began regularly 
        meditating again, just for a few minutes a day. 
        <br><br>
        I’ve started to feel happier and more calm again. It has been great to be reminded of a great practise that I fell out of.

      <h3>Conscious Listening</h3>
      <p>
        I’ve long felt that the modern world doesn’t leave a lot of time for listening. Talking a lot and drawing attention to
          yourself are highly rewarded while listening can even be criticised.
        <br><br>
        I’m reminded of the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Donald Trump got the attention of everyone - mostly of people who 
        proclaimed that they hated him, yet spent their time focussing on his antics.
        <br><br>
        Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton embarked on a “listening tour” in which she toured the country to hear the concerns of the people. 
        This was mostly ignored by the media and criticised as being “soft” when mentioned.
        <br><br>
        To have listening as an exercise in this course has therefore been refreshing. I enjoyed the conscious listening exercises and 
        look forward to doing more of this in the future.

      <h3>Overall Impressions</h3>
      <p>
        I’ve found the Core curriculum to be very useful. I was familiar with a lot of the concepts from previous work experience 
        and have always tried to incorporate them into my life. To be given a prime opportunity to practise these concepts has been 
        awesome and I look forward to doing more of it in boot camp. I think every tertiary course should have a Core component.
