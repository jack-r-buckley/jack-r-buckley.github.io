    <h2>What Makes a DevAcademy Student?</h2>
    <div class="article-paragraph">
      <p>
        In the first sprint, I reflected on who I am. I used prompt questions provided by the course and various personality 
        assessment tools available online. 
        <br><br>
        To keep things reasonably brief, this blog post contains several highlights from this reflection process I have curated. 
        This course will present challenges. The values, strengths and insecurities I have will determine the way I respond to them.
        <br><br>
        But that’s not the end of it. I always have the opportunity to grow through challenges. Who you are is not set in stone 
        and I can take these opportunities to change who I am for the better. In fact, it seems that this course is designed 
        with that in mind.  
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="article-paragraph">
      <h3>Culture and values</h3>
      <p>
        I was raised with liberal Western values. Growing up, I didn’t consider other value sets. I grew up with a cultural 
        narrative that our value system is superior and others do not need to be considered.
        <br><br>
        Some of these values are good. A commitment to personal liberty, justice and equality is admirable and I continue 
        to try to embody these in my daily life.
        <br><br>
        However, I see some contradictions in our values system that undermine these. It’s hard for a society to truly 
        uphold liberty and equality when it also has an uncompromising commitment to individualism and refuses to take 
        into account the context of people’s lives. When we expect the individual to solve all of their own problems 
        we do them a disservice.  
        <br><br>
        Because of this, the culture I was raised has ended up being as much of a marker of what I do not believe 
        in as what I do. I believe that a community is only as strong as its most unfortunate member and we have 
        a collective responsibility to help those who are struggling.
      </p>

    <div class="article-paragraph">
      <h3>Introversion</h3>
      <p>
        During this process I took an online quiz to determine my Myers-Briggs personality type. You know the one - ISFJ, ENTP and 
        so on. This is a framework of personality archetypes - prototypical models of the core essence of someone’s being.
        <br><br>
        While I don’t take these archetypes too seriously, I noticed something interesting. I took the test several times when 
        I was younger and always came out with the ENFP personality type:
        <ul>
            <li>Extraverted</li>
            <li>Intuitive</li>
            <li>Feeling</li>
            <li>Prospecting</li>
        </ul>
        This time I got most of the same results. However, I discovered I had become an introvert.
        <br><br>
        Always a quiet kid with just a few close friends, I learned how to put on a personality that would make people 
        interested in me. After a while, it felt completely natural. By the time I was in university I was known as a 
        social butterfly.
        <br><br>
        But, in the past couple of years I have felt a bit of regression in this regard. The social anxiety I used to feel 
        has come back and I have become a lot more comfortable just staying home and spending time by myself.

      <h3>Adaptability vs consistency</h3>
      <p>
        Last year, I was asked to complete a Clifton Strengths survey at work. Last week, I did a free online alternative. 
        The results were the same.
        <br><br>
        I hit it out of the park on one particular strength: adaptability. This makes a lot of sense. I easily pick up new 
        things and am able to establish a level of competence reasonably quickly. Last year, I was moved between different 
        project teams at work on a regular basis and always found my footing quickly.
        <br><br>
        The flipside to this is that I have poor consistency. I love starting projects but I hate finishing them. Right now, 
        this dynamic is helping me in this course because we are trying to gain an understanding of many concepts in a short 
        space of time. 
        <br><br>
        I will be challenged when it comes time to lock in and complete projects. This is something I need to focus on 
        learning because it will be the case when I have a job as a web developer too.

        <h3>Assertiveness and emotionality</h3>
        <p>
          I also took the DOPE test online. This test assigns you one of four personality archetypes named after famous birds.
          <br><br>
          I came out as the dove. Ever the harmony seeker, I am “people-oriented, loyal, friendly, hard working and a great team 
          player but [I tend] to avoid change, confrontation, risk-taking, and assertiveness”.
          <br><br>
          This is true. I will do almost anything to avoid conflict. This can put me in tough situations in work contexts. 
          Last year while working at the Tertiary Education Commission as a content writer, I frequently came into conflict 
          with people from other teams who wanted to dictate what our team wrote on our website.
          <br><br>
          Our team was in charge of the website and we were the experts on written content. However, others had more contact 
          with external stakeholders and wanted to make changes that would please them but reduce readability.
          <br><br>
          In the end, I know that the users of the website are more important than the stakeholders who are caught up on having 
          their marketing briefs adhered to. But, I made many concessions to avoid conflict. 
          <br><br>
          I want to work on becoming more assertive so I can stand up for myself and the people I represent.
