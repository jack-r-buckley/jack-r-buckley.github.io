    <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>
    <div class="article-paragraph">
      <p>
        In this course we have a heavy learning focus on emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence is all about 
        understanding, managing and using your emotions correctly. It’s also about communicating effectively and 
        empathising with others.
        <br><br>
        Working on your emotional intelligence has clear benefits to your mental and physical health, relationships 
        and professional success.

      <h3>Employability Skills</h3>  
        <p>
          Last year, while working at the Tertiary Education Commission, I worked on resources that provided information to 
          jobseekers about how to get jobs and be employable. There was a heavy focus on what we called ‘employability skills’, 
          which is a part of emotional intelligence.
          <br><br>
          There is a lot of evidence suggesting that communication, self-awareness and other employability skills are highly 
          sought after by employers - as much or more than technical skills.
          <br><br>
          I took this with a grain of salt until I started interviewing employers. They confirmed everything the evidence said 
          and then some. So what is emotional intelligence about and how can you improve yours?

      <h3>Why Improve your EQ?</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Improved health</strong>. If you can’t manage your emotions properly, it can cause stress and contribute to mental 
        illness. This can also affect you physically by causing high blood pressure, insomnia, high blood pressure and more.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Career success</strong>. Increasingly, employers are recognising that emotional skills contribute to 
        sustained success in the workplace. A raft of evidence shows that high emotional intelligence is correlated with 
        tangible success in professional contexts.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Better relationships</strong>. Improving your empathy, communication and emotional awareness will help 
        you forge and maintain personal and professional relationships. This in turn helps you in your career and with 
        sustaining happiness in your personal life.

      <h3>Developing a Toolkit</h3>
      <p>
        Improving emotional intelligence is about developing a set of techniques that can help your awareness and response 
        to your emotions and other people. Some of these techniques include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Meditation</strong>. Meditation improves your focus, reduces anxiety and helps you become aware of what is 
          happening both internally and externally.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Journaling</strong>. Writing down what happens to you and how you felt about it helps you track 
          things that trigger your emotions and reflect on how you responded to them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Active listening</strong>. Listening needs to be practised like anything else. 
          Improving your listening helps your communication which helps you to establish and maintain relationships.
