    <h2>JavaScript in Real Terms</h2>
    <div class="article-paragraph">
      <p>
        Last week we began learning JavaScript - “the language of the internet”. JavaScript controls much of the interactivity 
        we are used to on the internet. In this blog, we’ll take a look at what JavaScript is in plain English.
      </p>

    <div class="article-paragraph">
      <h3>HTML and CSS</h3>
      <p>
       Before we can look at what JavaScript does, we need to have a quick refresher about HTML and CSS. JavaScript often 
       interacts with HTML and CSS files to create dynamic content and visual styles that change and interact with the user.
       <br><br>
       HTML contains the content of the webpage - the text, images, links and so on - while the CSS contains instructions 
       about how the content should be displayed. It describes the fonts, colours, positions and other visual qualities 
       about the content elements.
       <br><br>
       During this sprint’s reflections, I came up with a story to describe their relationship. I told the tale of a young 
       boy who, eager to earn a coin from his mother for completing a chore, ran off to the tailor’s shop with only half 
       of the instructions for the clothes she wanted made.
       <br><br>
       The tailor looked at the boy and said I can’t do anything with this - I know she needs a dress and a blouse and so on, 
       but what fabric? What specifications? What colour? In the pictures below, you can see the effect for yourself. The one 
       on the right is what this website looks like with the style sheet turned off.
       </p>

      <h3>Control Flow and Loops</h3>
      <p>
        Most web pages contain scripts written in JavaScript that execute to handle all manner of interactions. When a script 
        runs, it executes its commands in sequential order. This order is called the control flow. 
        <br><br>
        We can also use loops to execute parts of the control flow again and again until a certain condition is reached. 
        Avoiding technical jargon, let’s look at the “control flow” for walking to the shops.
        <br><br>
        <ol>
            <li>If you’re in your house, leave your house.</li>
            <li>Point yourself towards the supermarket.</li>
            <li>Take a step forward.</li>
            <li>If you are not at the supermarket, go back to step 3.</li>
            <li>Enter the shop.</li>
        </ol>
        <br><br>
        In this flow, a loop executes at steps 3 and 4. As long as the condition of being at the supermarket is not yet 
        reached, you continue to loop that part of the code, which leads to you walking.
      </p>
    </div>
  
    
    <div class="article-paragraph">
      <h3>Relative</h3>
      <p>
        The element will take its normal place in the flow of the document, but you can move it around relative to this position.
        <br><br>
        Using the commands <strong>top</strong>, <strong>right</strong>, <strong>bottom</strong> and <strong>left</strong>, you can 
        add space on each side of the element that will push it around on the page. Here, the code <strong>left: 100px;</strong> is 
        used to add 100 pixels of space to the left of where it was previously.
        <br><br>
        You can also use the command <strong>z-index</strong> to determine the depth of the element. Where two elements overlap 
        each other, the one with the higher z-index will appear on top.
      </p>
    </div>
    

    <div class="article-paragraph">
      <h3>The DOM</h3>   
      <p>
        Walking to the shops is fine, but we want our scripts to interact with our website elements. This happens through the 
        Document Object Model (DOM).
        <br><br>
        This is an interface that maps out all of the elements on a website into a tree. The viewing window contains the 
        document itself, which contains the body of the document, which contains all the headings and images, and so on.
        <br><br>
        Elements in the DOM can be “grabbed” by your JavaScript. After you get a hold of these elements, you can do all 
        manner of things to them. For example, you can “grab” all of the images in your document and then run a script that 
        turns them upside down when the user clicks a button.
        <br><br>
        You wouldn’t, but that’s a different question. 
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="article-image-container">
      <img src="../images/blog-javascript/dom-diagram.jpg" class="article-image">
      <div class="article-inset">
        <p>
          This diagram represents a highly simplified version of the DOM. In reality, the DOM has hundreds and 
          hundreds of branches and objects.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="article-paragraph">
      <h3>Arrays and Objects</h3>
      <p>
        JavaScript lets you create arrays and objects that take a whole bunch of values, give them names and store them under 
        one heading. These are very useful for describing things in the real world. 
        <br><br>
        Think about your kitchen cupboard. You could create a JavaScript object called <strong>cupboard()</strong> that contains 
        items like <strong>plates: 3</strong> and <strong>cups: 10</strong>. Then, you can simply access 
        <strong>cupboard.plates</strong> to know how many plates we have (this would return 3).
        <br><br>
        Arrays are similar, but instead of giving the values names, you simply have a bunch of values with an index. 
        You can imagine this like a database of phone numbers. 
        <br><br>
        In the array <strong>phone-numbers[‘021123456’, ‘021234567’, ‘021345678’]</strong> we have three numbers 
        that we can access. The only trick is that it starts counting at 0. So, the first number is indexed at 0, 
        the second at 1, and so on.
        <br><br>
        In this case, asking for <strong>phone-numbers[2]</strong> gives us the value ‘021345678’.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="article-paragraph">
      <h3>Functions</h3>
      <p>
        Functions are where JavaScript gets really good. A function is just a block of code that gets a name. When you call 
        that name in your script, it executes the function. For example, you could call a function that displays a 
        message saying “hello”. But that’s no fun.
        <br><br>
        Functions can be as complicated as you like. They drive browser games, search large databases for information 
        and display complicated animations. The only limits are your imagination - and your coding ability.
