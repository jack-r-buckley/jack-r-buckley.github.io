    <h2>Neuroplasticity and the Growth Mindset</h2>
        <div class="article-paragraph">
          <p>
            Everyone knows that children soak up new knowledge like a sponge. Another commonly-held belief is that adults don’t 
            have the same capacity to learn. But this isn’t necessarily true. Our brains retain the ability to create and rearrange 
            their neural circuitry throughout our whole lives.
            <br><br>
            This means that we can learn new things throughout our whole lives. But, you have to have 
            the right mindset.
          </p>

        <div class="article-paragraph">
          <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
          <p>
            ‘Neuroplasticity’ means the ability of the brain to create new neurons and form new connections 
            between neurons.
            <br><br>
            Neurons are brain cells. They transmit electrical impulses to each other in vast circuits. The way 
            these circuits are arranged affect our personalities, skills and habits.
            <br><br>
            Scientists once believed that the brain was only neuroplastic during childhood - that adults have brain 
            patterns that are more or less fixed.
            <br><br>
            Now we know better. Scientists call it ‘activity-dependent plasticity’ - a form of neuroplasticity that 
            arises from doing and thinking things. From personal experience. If you’re right-handed you can eventually train 
            yourself to write with your left hand with enough practice. 
            <br><br>
            This doesn’t just apply to physical skills. You can also learn personal habits and patterns of thought. 
            So what does this mean for our lives?

          <h3>The Growth Mindset</h3>
          <p>
            When you realise that your brain has the ability to rewire itself throughout your whole life it emerges 
            that you can always get better at things.
            <br><br>
            If you don’t believe this you may fall into negative attitudes towards your own growth. You may start to 
            say things like “I’m just not that smart” or “I’m lazy”.
            <br><br>
            These things may be true at one particular point in time but they can always change - because of our 
            neuroplasticity. Our ability to learn and to change.
            <br><br>
            When you believe that your skills, talents and personality traits are immutable this leads to a ‘fixed mindset’. 
            People with a fixed mindset struggle to expand themselves because they put limits on themselves.
            <br><br>
            On the other hand you can have a growth mindset. You can believe that you can always change for the better. 
            Having a growth mindset will ultimately lead you to greater success in your personal and professional life.
